    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl combine the paprika, smoked paprika, dried cilantro, oregano, coriander powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well. Brush the fillet with 1 tablespoon (15mL) of olive oil, and then rub the fillet gently with the spice mixture. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 12 hours.
            Preheat the oven to 450°F (232°C).</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat with another tablespoon (15mL) of olive oil. Add in the finely chopped cilantro and the lime zest and juice, and swirl the pan to mix.</li>
        <li>Lay the fish on the pan, skin side down. Baste the fish in the lime- cilantro mixture for 1.5-2 minutes, before flipping and repeating for another 2 minutes. Baste with the remaining tablespoon (15mL) of olive oil before removing from pan.</li>
        <li>Move the fish to a foil-lined baking sheet and roast in the oven for 10-12 minutes – the fish will flake easily and turn opaque throughout when it’s cooked through.</li>
