    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice and place it into a claypot or non-stick pot, along with all the other ingredients listed above.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook for about 20 mins on low heat. Test a grain to see whether it is done.</li>
        <li>Mix well, and put into a bowl, packing it slightly so that it will retain its shape after you turn it over.</li>
        <li>Turn rice over onto deep soup plate.</li>
        <li>Beat all the eggs while heating up a large non-stick pan with oil.</li>
        <li>If you just want to make a giant one to share between 2 people, use all of it at once, if not, use half at a time. Scramble desired amount of egg just as it hits the pan, and cover to let it settle into a semi-omelette.</li>
        <li>When the egg is half-done, quickly slide it off the pan onto the rice. Since the egg is not fully cooked, this is why it’s called ‘creamy’.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, wiped clean with a paper towel, put the toppings (dashi, peas and crab pieces) and heat till it simmers.</li>
        <li>When it starts to simmer, add in the soy sauce, oyster sauce and vinegar. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Mix the starch and water to form a slurry.</li>
        <li>After a minute of simmering, or when both peas and crab are cooked, switch off the heat and mix the slurry in. Keep stirring until the entire sauce is evenly thick.</li>
        <li>Arrange the three crab pieces on top per omelette, and pour the sauce and peas over the rice!</li>
        <li>Gain 100 in Attack and Magic, and increase your HP by over 400!</li>
    </ol>
